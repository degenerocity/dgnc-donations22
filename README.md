# Degenerocity Donations 2022

## Digital Dust Re-imagined

This project was originally started with the intention of providing a quick and easy way for community members to purge their wallets of old dusty NFT's they no longer want. If you have been into the NFT minting scene for any period of time you'll know that it is a hit or miss endeavor. You put endless hours of time aside chasing the latest mint and the more rare traits in hopes of landing yourself that ultra rare white list spot on some blue chip NFT that will make you millions. In the wake of your degenerate life chasing these gains you are often left with a lot of old, ill-liquid NFT's that you don't want to burn but also don't want crowding up your main minting wallet when you are racing to get transactions out. 

## Digital NFT Museum

Degenerocity Donation Wallets are your solution to this problem. Now you can donate all these dusty NFT's to our NFT Museum so that you can ensure they will be given the care and attention they deserve. 

We have highered the worlds first digital NFT museum curator. Their job will be to catalog, sort, rate, and store our ever growing collection of purchased and donated NFT's. Over the next few years we will be exploring in our labs how to best accomplish these goals.
